Our analysis code can be located in the AnovaStatusReport.pdf file, which is a pre-run version of the AnovaTestCode.R.
This means that the outputs by AnovaTestCode.R can be viewed through the html file, and there is nothing you have to do with the AnovaTestCode.R file.

Our initial analysis and reflection questions can be found in the clean.ipynb file and our functions we used inside of the clean.ipynb file can be found
inside of DFfunctions.py

We have four sets of data, heart and stroke initial data. Our "updated" csv files are our two final cleaned datasets.
