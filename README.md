Our analysis code can be located in the AnovaStatusReport.html file, which is a pre-run version of the AnovaTestCode.R.
This means that the outputs by AnovaTestCode.R can be viewed if the html file is downloaded and opened through a browser.
The output can also be viewed through the Statistical Anova Analysis.pdf.

Our initial analysis and reflection questions can be found in the clean.ipynb file and our functions we used inside of the clean.ipynb file can be found
inside of DFfunctions.py

We have four sets of data, heart and stroke initial data. Our "updated" csv files are our two final cleaned datasets.
